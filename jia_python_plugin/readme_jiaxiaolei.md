Copying helloworld.egg-info to /root/my_snap_demo/jia_python_plugin/parts/my-python-app/install/lib/python3.6/site-packages/helloworld-0.1-py3.6.egg-info
running install_scripts
Installing helloworld_in_python script to /root/my_snap_demo/jia_python_plugin/parts/my-python-app/install/bin
writing list of installed files to 'install.txt'
You are using pip version 9.0.1, however version 19.3.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
Failed to stage: Parts 'python' and 'my-python-app' have the following files, but with different contents:
    usr/bin/pydoc3
    usr/bin/python3

Snapcraft offers some capabilities to solve this by use of the following keywords:
    - `filesets`
    - `stage`
    - `snap`
    - `organize`

To learn more about these part keywords, run `snapcraft help plugins`.
