# DOSBox snap

This project creates a working snap of DOSBox from a tarball snapshot of upstream svn.

To get this done, we need to do the following:
 - build from current svn snapshot

## Current state

Working features:
 - dosbox

Known issues:
  - Audio doesn't work, but this is a problem with snappy, not this snap
